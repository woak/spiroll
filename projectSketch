----------------------------Project Sketch----------------------------

We propose to make a new functionality for use in JavaScript/HTML code in the
form of a JavaScript object. The functionality added would be for the user to
be able to move his or her mouse in a spiral motion while holding ctrl in order
to scroll, instead of having to constantly pick up one's hand as is currently
necessary with the two finger approach. When ctrl is pressed, the current mouse
point is stored and displayed as the origin about which the mouse rotates.
The direction of the mouse movement, and thus direction of scrool, is
determined by its transition from one "slice" to the next, based on the angle
of the mouse relative to the x-axis of the origin.

----------------------------Technology Requirements----------------------------

We have little to no experience with JavaScript or HTML, and will need to become
familiar with both in order to make this software web-friendly.

Included in this is the requirement to learn to develop software specifically
to be utilized as a Google Chrome Extension.

The requirements for this project are low technologically, in that all the
functionality we plan on using (eg: scrolling a webpage and calculating the
arcsin) are built into the JavaScript language as it is.
----------------------------Technology Feasibility----------------------------

An html page of the first 10 chapters of:
From Canal Boy to President or the Boyhood and Manhood of James A. Garfield
by Horatio Alger, Jr.

This will illustrate how annoying it is to pick one's hand up when one needs to
scroll over a long page, and will serve as the test file for our project.

The feasibility is extremely high for this project, as the only technology
utilized is built into the JavaScript and HTML languages. There are no risks as
to whether this project will be possible.
