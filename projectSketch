----------------------------Project Sketch----------------------------



----------------------------Technology Requirements----------------------------
	We have no experience with JavaScript or HTML, and will need to become
	familiar with both in order to make this software web-friendly.

	Included in this is requirement of learning to develop software
	specifically as a Google Chrome Extension.

----------------------------Technology Feasability----------------------------

An html page of the first 10 chapters of:

From Canal Boy to President or the Boyhood and Manhood of James A. Garfield
by Horatio Alger, Jr.

This will illustrate how annoying it is to pick one's hand up when one needs to
scroll over a long page, and will serve as the test file for our project.
